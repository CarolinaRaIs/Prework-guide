        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development: HTML, CSS, and JS</li>
          <li>The head element element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>When create the structure for a webpage, you use a series of HTML elements to define the content and framework. These HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. CSS adds style to our webpage.</li>
          <li>We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options. CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage (save) and keep track of each version of your project. </li>
          <li>Git commands always start with 'git'.</li>
          <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but to collaborate with others, you need to use a Git-based repository hosting service such as GitHub, Bitbucket and SourceForge. GitHub is free to share work and collaborate.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>The browser reads code in the order it appears in the file, so placing JavaScript near the bottom of an HTML page is one way to accommodate this.</li>
          <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line. However, some people believe it's good practice to have semicolons at the end of each statement.</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code.</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement. The expression inside the if () is the test. If this comparison returns true, the first block of code runs. If the comparison is not true, the second block of code—after the elsestatement—runs instead.</li>
          <li>Arrays are regular objects for which there is a particular relationship between integer-keyed properties and the length property</li>
        </ul>
